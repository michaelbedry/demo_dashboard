A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

When you first start up, vs-code should ask you to execute and get all missing packages. This may take a while. You will also need to execute the following command to make sure all generated code is up to date:

flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

The above command is very common and you will be executing it several times during development. If you are doing a lot of development you may want to change the "build" item in the command to "watch" and it will automatically execute the command everytime to save your changes.
